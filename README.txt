This is TECkit, a library for encoding conversion, usable through standalone
tools or by linking with other software packages.

See the Documentation folder for information on the TECkit mapping language
and conversion tool usage notes.

The TECkit libraries have been updated to support the Unicode 9.0.0 character
repertoire.
